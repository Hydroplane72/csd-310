How often should users and their permissions be monitored? Why?

	Users and their permissions should be monitored constantly. You should conduct a thorough review of each user and their permissions to the system at least annually. When a user changes rank, leaves the company, or after a security incident, you should also conduct a thorough review of the user's access to the system. 
	With that said, you should be constantly monitoring users and what they access to identify potential patterns that may not seem correct. Doing this is especially important when there are multiple attempts to gain access to data that has been denied to the user. Numerous attempts to access data that a user should not have can indicate that the user may have been compromised.
	The frequency at which a user accesses sensitive information in the system should also be reviewed regularly. My work has a general rule that it should be avoided to return anything that contains more than a single point of PII in a response. At the same time, this is obviously not something that can be upheld all of the time. By having that rule, it prompts us to have discussions with Information Security to ensure that it is necessary to provide this data to the user.
	Another way to think of the system I work in is as a 'no-trust' system. You should never trust that a process has not been compromised at any point as much as possible. This mentality keeps us, as developers, more aware of how the data we are working with could be used against us at any time. Doing this, in turn, encourages us to develop secure code and coding practices that do not cut corners when it comes to authentication and authorization at every step.
